I am a research engineer specializing in the understanding, modeling, and optimization of materials' mechanical behavior. I hold the position of Associate Professor at the [School of Mechanical and Electrical Engineering](https://cmee.csu.edu.cn/), [Central South University in China](https://www.csu.edu.cn/).

I welcome contact from those interested in potential collaborations; I am receptive to new ideas and suggestions and eager to engage with researchers in academia or industry. Outstanding students and scholars are encouraged to inquire about opportunities for PhD and postdoctoral positions.
